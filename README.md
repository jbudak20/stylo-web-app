# Stylo

Welcome to Sytlo - a modern webshop built using CMS and MACH architecture.

This project was created by a team of students, including myself, as a part of course at the University of Zagreb, <a href="https://foi.unizg.hr" target="_blank">Faculty of Organization and Informatics</a>.
The project was mentored and reviewed by <a href="https://ibmix.de/en/" target="_blank">IBM iX</a> and was documented and developed using SCRUM methodology alongside Jira and Confluence tools.

## Application Overview and Core Functionalities

The Stylo application is an e-commerce platform designed to seamlessly integrate Content Management System (CMS) capabilities with e-commerce functionalities, leveraging the MACH (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, and Headless) architecture. The platform primarily focuses on the sale of footwear and offers tailored roles for administrators, employees, and customers, ensuring efficient operations and an optimized shopping experience.

### Employee Management Features
- Employees can oversee product listings, manage product categories, review customer order data, and update order statuses
- Through the CMS, employees can create, update, and delete web pages, ensuring a dynamic and up-to-date online presence
- Currently, administrators are responsible for adding employees to the system.

### Customer Experience and Capabilities
- Browsing and Shopping: Customers can explore categories, filter and sort products, and view detailed product pages with information such as price, images, availability, descriptions, and product names
- Purchasing: The shopping cart allows for seamless card-based transactions, with invoices automatically sent to customers via email
- Support: Customers can reach out to employees through a contact or customer support form for assistance

### Account Registration and Activation
- Unregistered users can easily register on the platform, receiving an activation email to confirm their accounts and gain full access.

## Architecture

Application is composed of 3 parts:
<ul>
  <li> Web app frontend: the main UI of the app</li>
   <li> Native android app: MVP version of web app that has modular login and registration that was required by FOI</li>
   <li> Backend: which contains 4 microservices</li>
</ul>

The backend comprises four interconnected microservices, facilitated by an API gateway such as Kong. The microservices include:
<ul>
  <li>    Products - integrates data from our headless Ecommerce and CMS APIs (products, product details, categories, webshop and homepage layout)</li>
  <li>    Receipts -  includes creation of PDF receipt which are meant to be sent to customers</li>
   <li>   Emails - used for sending mails to customers (account verfication, receiving a PDF invoice on email)</li>
   <li>   Customers - customer registration and login</li>
</ul>
